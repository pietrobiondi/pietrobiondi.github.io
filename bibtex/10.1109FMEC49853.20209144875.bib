  abstract={VoIP phones are early representatives as well as present enhancers of the IoT. This paper observes that they are still widely used in a traditional, unsecured configuration and demonstrates the Phonejack family of attacks: Phonejack 1 conjectures the exploitation of phone vulnerabilities; Phonejack 2 demonstrates how to mount a denial-of-service attack on a network of phones; Phonejack 3 sniffs calls. It is reassuring, however, that inexpensive devices such as a Raspberry Pi can be configured and programmed as effective countermeasures, thus supporting the approach of integrating both technologies. A video clip demonstrates both attacks and defence measures [14]. The concluding evaluations argue that trusting the underlying network security measures may turn out overly optimistic; moreover, VoIP phones really ought to be protected as laptops routinely are today.},
